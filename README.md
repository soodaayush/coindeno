## Inspiration

I’ve always been fascinated by crypto, and when I came across the CoinGecko app, it clicked. What better way to dive into React Native than by building something similar? CoinDeno started as a learning project, but quickly became much more: a real, functional app that helped me explore the world of mobile development and crypto tracking.

## Challenges

Publishing to the app stores was no walk in the park. Between meeting platform requirements and debugging weird edge cases, I spent hours making sure everything was up to standard. It was frustrating at times, but also incredibly rewarding.

## Lessons Learned

- The ins and outs of React Native — from navigation to state management
- How to define and deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- The not-so-glamorous but essential process of submitting to the App Store and Google Play (spoiler: it’s harder than it looks!)

## The App

CoinDeno is your personal crypto companion. Here’s what it does:

- 📈 Live crypto price tracking powered by the CoinGecko API
- 💰 Build and manage your own custom coin portfolio
- 🌍 View prices in your local currency for easy conversions
- 💡 Clean, responsive UI optimized for both iOS and Android
